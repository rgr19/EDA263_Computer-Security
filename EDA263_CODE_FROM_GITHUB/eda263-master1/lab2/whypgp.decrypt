It's personal. It's private. And it's no one's business but yours.
You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or
having an illicit affair. Or you may be doing something that you
feel shouldn't be illegal, but is. Whatever it is, you don't want
your private electronic mail (E-mail) or confidential documents read
by anyone else. There's nothing wrong with asserting your privacy.
Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.
</p><p>
Perhaps you think your E-mail is legitimate enough that encryption
is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing
to hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on
postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why require a
warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying to hide
something? You must be a subversive or a drug dealer if you hide
your mail inside envelopes. Or maybe a paranoid nut. Do law-abiding
citizens have any need to encrypt their E-mail?
</p><p>
What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use
postcards for their mail? If some brave soul tried to assert his
privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion.
Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he's hiding.
Fortunately, we don't live in that kind of world, because everyone
protects most of their mail with envelopes. So no one draws
suspicion by asserting their privacy with an envelope. There's
safety in numbers. Analogously, it would be nice if everyone
routinely used encryption for all their E-mail, innocent or not, so
that no one drew suspicion by asserting their E-mail privacy with
encryption. Think of it as a form of solidarity.
</p><p>
Today, if the Government wants to violate the privacy of ordinary
citizens, it has to expend a certain amount of expense and labor to
intercept and steam open and read paper mail, and listen to and
possibly transcribe spoken telephone conversation. This kind of
labor-intensive monitoring is not practical on a large scale. This
is only done in important cases when it seems worthwhile.
</p><p>
More and more of our private communications are being routed through
electronic channels. Electronic mail is gradually replacing
conventional paper mail. E-mail messages are just too easy to
intercept and scan for interesting keywords. This can be done
easily, routinely, automatically, and undetectably on a grand scale.
International cablegrams are already scanned this way on a large
scale by the NSA.
</p><p>
We are moving toward a future when the nation will be crisscrossed
with high capacity fiber optic data networks linking together all
our increasingly ubiquitous personal computers. E-mail will be the
norm for everyone, not the novelty it is today. The Government will
protect our E-mail with Government-designed encryption protocols.
Probably most people will acquiesce to that. But perhaps some people
will prefer their own protective measures.
</p><p>
Senate Bill 266, a 1991 omnibus anti-crime bill, had an unsettling
measure buried in it. If this non-binding resolution had become real
law, it would have forced manufacturers of secure communications
equipment to insert special trap doors in their products, so that
the Government can read anyone's encrypted messages. It reads:</p><p>

</p><blockquote><font size="-1">
"It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic
communications services and manufacturers of electronic
communications service equipment shall insure that
communications systems permit the Government to obtain the
plain text contents of voice, data, and other
communications when appropriately authorized by law."
</font></blockquote>
<p>
     
This measure was defeated after rigorous protest from civil
libertarians and industry groups.
</p><p>
In 1992, the FBI Digital Telephony wiretap proposal was introduced
to Congress. It would require all manufacturers of communications
equipment to build in special remote wiretap ports that would enable
the FBI to remotely wiretap all forms of electronic communication
from FBI offices. Although it never attracted any sponsors in
Congress in 1992 because of citizen opposition, it was reintroduced
in 1994.
</p><p>
Most alarming of all is the White House's bold new encryption policy
initiative, under development at NSA since the start of the Bush
administration, and unveiled April 16th, 1993. The centerpiece of
this initiative is a Government-built encryption device, called the
Clipper chip, containing a new classified NSA encryption algorithm.
The Government is encouraging private industry to design it into all
their secure communication products, like secure phones, secure FAX,
etc.  AT&amp;T is now putting the Clipper into their secure voice
products. The catch: At the time of manufacture, each Clipper chip
will be loaded with its own unique key, and the Government gets to
keep a copy, placed in escrow. Not to worry, though -- the
Government promises that they will use these keys to read your
traffic only when duly authorized by law. Of course, to make Clipper
completely effective, the next logical step would be to outlaw other
forms of cryptography.
</p><p>
If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy. Intelligence
agencies have access to good cryptographic technology. So do the big
arms and drug traffickers. So do defense contractors, oil companies,
and other corporate giants. But ordinary people and grassroots
political organizations mostly have not had access to affordable
military grade public-key cryptographic technology. Until now.
</p><p>
PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands.
There's a growing social need for it. That's why I wrote it.
