	(2) The problem on the site is that it does not sanitize user input. 

	(3) The ' char ends the user input string and then gives an OR statement 
	that always will be true and comment out the rest of the sql code.
	This means that the logical check of the username 'usr' will always
	return true.

Assignment 2
