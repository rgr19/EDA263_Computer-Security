  abstract = {This paper gives the main definitions relating to dependability, a
	generic <span class='snippet'>concept</span> including a special
	case <span class='snippet'>of</span> such attributes as reliability,
	availability, safety, integrity, maintainability, etc. Security brings
	in concerns for confidentiality, in addition to availability <span
	class='snippet'>and</span> integrity. <span class='snippet'>Basic</span>
	definitions are given first. They are then commented upon, <span
	class='snippet'>and</span> supplemented by additional definitions,
	which address the threats to dependability <span class='snippet'>and</span>
	security (faults, errors, failures), their attributes, <span class='snippet'>and</span>
	the means for their achievement (fault prevention, fault tolerance,
	fault removal, fault forecasting). The aim is to explicate a set
	<span class='snippet'>of</span> general <span class='snippet'>concepts</span>,
	<span class='snippet'>of</span> relevance across a wide range <span
	class='snippet'>of</span> situations <span class='snippet'>and</span>,
	therefore, helping communication <span class='snippet'>and</span>
	cooperation among a number <span class='snippet'>of</span> scientific
	<span class='snippet'>and</span> technical communities, including
	ones that are concentrating on particular types <span class='snippet'>of</span>
	system, <span class='snippet'>of</span> system failures, or <span
	class='snippet'>of</span> causes <span class='snippet'>of</span>
	system failures.},
